1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
'mkdir directory_name' makes a new directroy
'mv og_file_path new_file_path' moves a file from one directory to another 
'python3 file_name' runs a python file in code
'nano file_name' allows your to edit a file in your terminal. (like I am doing now)
2. Do you have pets? What kind?
I have a dog, Skippy, and a ball python snake, Reggie. 
3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
READ THE ERROR! (I learned that well doing this homework, unfortunately, lol) The error almost always tells you what is wrong, or at least points you in the right direction. 
4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
Picture this. I just ate up a performance (in jazz band), made it all the way down two flights of stairs, just to absolutely EAT IT on the last 4 or 
5 steps. I was carrying my instrument and boba. Instrument was saved, boba was lost, and I hadn't drank any of it yet. On top of that, I was litterally
bleeding when I got back to the bus, and one of our trumpet players saw me limping and carrying my heels, and decided it would be funny to point at my
feet and call them ugly. High school was such a time lol. 
5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
A python script is essentially a line/file of code that is written and can be run in your command line, which the computer interprets as code.
